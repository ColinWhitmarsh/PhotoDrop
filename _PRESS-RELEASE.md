Announcing PhotoDrop, a new location-based photo sharing iPhone app 

## Sub-Heading ##
PhotoDrop allows iOS users to find and share photos based on their current geolocation.

## Summary ##
PhotoDrop offers two main functions: PhotoShare and PhotoExplore. With PhotoShare, users can take photos with the app and store them at their current location for other users to see. With PhotoExplore, users can open the app and see the photos that other users have stored at their current location.

## Problem ##
Existing photo sharing apps don't connect users based on geolocation.

## Solution ##
PhotoDrop adds an extra layer to photo sharing, making it fun for people share photos of places they've been and to connect with other users as they explore new places.
